<p id="demo">Click the button to execute Fizz Buzz game.<br />
The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 15, which is both become fizz buzz. The game parameters are 1 to 100. So the output should resemble: <br />1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ... <br />Via example: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz</a>
